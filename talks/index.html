				This is where an online copy of some talks I have prepared will go.
				This page partially serves as a place for individuals to get a scope of my interests,
				and partially for me to keep an online copy of my slides/write-ups

        <li> <b>Bogolyubov's lemma and Bohr sets</b> (January 2026)<br>
          Part of a sequence of talks given by students at the end of a
          selected topics course at the University of Bonn on higher-order Fourier analysis.
          The talks aimed to present a proof of the inverse theorem for the
          U<sup>3</sup> Gowers norm on arbitrary finite abelian groups
          as done in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13759"> this paper</a>.
          My talk focused on preliminary results: Bogolyubov's lemma, a statement about gauranteeing
          a large Bohr set in 2A - 2A, and its further generalization when A is
          the subset of a Bohr set, the latter making use of
          some Fourier-analytic properties of Bohr sets.</li>
        <li> <b> Kloosterman sums and applications to the circle method</b> (December 2025) <br>
          Delivered as part of a graduate seminar at the University of Bonn,
          covering the delta symbol method of Heath-Brown,
          which establishes a quantitative Hasse principle for quadratic forms.
          I went through some classic properties of Gauss and Kloosterman sums,
          before applying them to produce explicit formulae for
          the prime terms of the singular series.
          The results I presented here were to be used in subsequent talks
          to prove the results obtained in the original paper.
        <li> <b> Progression-free sets in &#x2124;<sub>4</sub><sup>n</sup></b> (September 2025) <br>
					Presentation delivered at the Kopf Summer School, whose focus was
          on discrete directions in harmonic analysis.
          This talk went through the proof by Croot, Lev, and Pach,
          directly following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01506"> this paper</a>.</li>
				<li> <b>Square Differences and Undergraduate Research</b> (March 2025) <br>
					Invited speaker for UBC Math's undergraduate colloquium.
					The talk highlighted easy to understand components of some
					of the research I did the previous summer, as well as focused
					on some of the day-to-day experiences as an undergraduate researcher
					for students currently looking to get more involved.</li>
				<li> <b>Proving Fermat's Last Theorem mod p</b> (March 2025) <br>
					Delivered a talk for UBC's math circle, a weekly meeting for
					local high schoolers interested in mathematics.
					I went through graph theoretic approach to
					(dis)proving Fermat's Last Theorem modulo a prime.
					The presentation was based off of the introduction to
					<a href="https://yufeizhao.com/gtacbook/"> Yufei Zhao's book</a>,
					as well as material presented in a course I was taking at the time.
				</li>
				<li> <b>An Introduction to the Fractal Uncertainty Principle </b> (December 2024) <br>
					Made for credit in an introductory harmonic analysis course, UBC's Math 404/541.
					Introduces what the fractal uncertainty principle is,
					similar to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02599"> Dyatlov's introductory article</a>,
					but more aligned with what students of the class had covered.
				</li>
				<li> <b> UBC Math 220 Review Session </b> (December 2024) <br>
					Hosted a review session for UBC's introduction to proofs course,
					to help prepare students for their final exam.
				</li>
				<li> <b>A Look at the Fourier Transform</b> (July 2024) <br>
					An expository talk for a general undergraduate audience at
					the Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference.
					Focused on a heuristic understanding of what the Fourier transform is,
					based off of the many different places it pops up
					(Fourier series, the discrete Fourier transform, etc.).
				<li> <b>Density Increment Strategies</b> (June 2024) <br>
					A talk delivered at a weekly seminar for current UBC undergraduate summer
					researchers in mathematics.
					Based off of the first section of <a href="https://www.juliawolf.org/teaching/iac_notes.pdf"> these notes by Julia Wolf</a>
					and the first lecture of <a href="http://thomasbloom.org/teaching/DIAC.pdf"> these notes by Thomas Bloom</a>.
				</li>
				<li> <b>Avoiding Patterns in Sets: the Erdős Similarity Problem</b> (July 2023) <br>
					Intended for a general undergraduate audience at
					the Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conferences.
					Built up an understanding of what the Erdős Similarity Problem was,
					as well as some known results and their implications.

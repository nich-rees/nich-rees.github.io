				Hi, this is the personal website of Nicholas Rees.<br>
				I am an undergraduate studying math at UBC, expected to graduate Spring 2025.
				I am currently <br> looking for admission in Fall 2025 to
				graduate programs in pure mathematics.
				My interests are <br> largely related to analysis.
				Some current topics that I could see myself working on
				include problems in harmonic analysis,
				particularly those with geometric connections.
				This has drawn me to the <br> Fourier restriction conjecture,
				Kakeya conjecture, and other connections with discrete and fractal <br> geometry.
				I am also interested in exploring topics in additive combinatorics.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can reach me at nicholaskrees &ltat&gt gmail &ltdot&gt com.<br>
				This site is still under construction,
				so bear with me if it is a little rough around the edges.

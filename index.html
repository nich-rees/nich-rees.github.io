				Hi, this is the personal website of Nicholas Rees.<br>
        I am a Masters student at the University of Bonn, studying pure mathematics.
				My interests are largely related to number theory,
        typically with an analytic flavour.
        Some current areas are in the applications of ideas from
        harmonic analysis, such as in higher-order Fourier analysis.
        I also have some interest in problems originating from harmonic analysis
        and geometric measure theory, like the Kakeya and restriction problems.
        In the near future, I hope to try to learn more on the topics
        of automorphic forms, ergodic theory,
        and applications of algebraic geometry to analytic number theory.

				External to mathematics, I am also interested in formal proof assistants
				and programming languages, as well as topics in AI safety
				(both from a technical and policy perspective).
				Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking in nearby mountains,
				rock climbing and bouldering,
				and playing/watching football (soccer) and basketball.
				<a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">This comic sums me up pretty well.</a>

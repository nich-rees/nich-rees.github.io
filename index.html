				Hi, this is the personal website of Nicholas Rees.<br>
				I am an undergraduate studying math at UBC, expected to graduate Spring 2025.
				I am currently looking for admission in Fall 2025 to
				graduate programs in pure mathematics.
				My interests are largely related to analysis.
				Some current topics that I could see myself working on
				include problems in the intersection of
				harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory,
				such as those related to the Kakeya conjecture,
				Fourier restriction, and fractal geometry.
				I am also interested in related discrete applications,
				such as in additive combinatorics, analytic number theory,
				and incidence geometry.
			</p>
			<p>
				External to mathematics, I am also interested in formal proof assistants
				and programming languages, as well as topics in AI safety
				(both from a technical and policy perspective).
				Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking in nearby mountains,
				rock climbing and bouldering,
				and playing/watching football (soccer) and basketball.
				I also enjoy fooling around with some coding and my linux setup.
				<a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">This comic sums me up pretty well.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				You can reach me at nicholaskrees &ltat&gt gmail &ltdot&gt com.<br>
				This site is still under construction,
				so bear with me if it is a little rough around the edges.
